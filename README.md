Transform Your Data & Perform Light EDA

After creating your repository and answering your analytical questions you should begin your data collection process using your API & Web-Scraping skills. Note that the completion of your code is dependent on your ability to look up documentation, and previous lectures, as well as your ability to work with your teammates. Subsequently, we recommend that you complete the code based on best practices that you've learned throughout the fellowship, as opposed to explicit instructions.

At the same time, we recommend that you have the following file at minimum:

data_ingestion.py: A Python module that pulls data from an API or web scrapes. This file will then write your unstructured data into a CSV file.
After completing this module, each team member will conduct their own EDA. That is, every single team member should create a file called [name]_eda.ipynb in the notebooks "folder" and explore the data using univariate and bivariate techniques. For example, if Mickal and I were completing this project, we would have the following files:

notebooks/farukh_eda.ipynb
notebooks/mickal_eda.ipynb
By completing separate EDAs,  we're able to split the workload of analyzing the dataset and come to independent conclusions which we can then share with the team.

Part 3: Stand-Up

For this final step, you will present the features you've completed (or will complete) in a "light" 10-minute standup. No slides are necessary! You will simply answer:

What have you accomplished?
What are your roadblocks?
What will you accomplish next?
A demo of your work would be appreciated as well!

Data Collection Options:

Note: While you are not limited to this list of data collection resources, your selected resource must contain a dependent variable and it must not be a CSV file.

We provide examples of dependent variables for each resource.
